== What is nailed?

+nailed+ consists of a back-end CLI for data collection and a sinatra based web front-end for visualization of relevant development data of Products that have their bugtracker on Bugzilla and (optionally) their codebase on GitHub and their CI on Jenkins.

+Be+ +aware+ that the bugzilla layout (metadata) is still SUSE specific, which may not be useful for everybody.
e.g. it relies on bugs being tagged as L3. The plan is to make it optional in the future.

== Installation using gem
   gem install 'nailed'

   Note that this is always a bit outdated.

== Installation using git (recommended)
You can use nailed directly from a git checkout as well. Make sure to fetch the dependencies and call `nailed` from the `bin` directory.
=== SUSE
   zypper in libxml2-devel sqlite3-devel gcc make ruby-devel
   bundle install
